\subsection{Second point}
\label{ssec:2S}

\par In this point, the goal is to simulate the operating point for $v_s(0)=0$. In order to accomplish this, we replaced the capacitor with a voltage source $V_x=V(6)-V(8)$, where $V(6)$ and $V(8)$ are the voltages in nodes 6 and 8, respectively, found in point 1. This step is, as explained in subsection \ref{ssec:2T}, based on ThÃ©venin's theorem: we replace the capacitor with $V_s$, then we analyse all node voltages and branch currents; then, knowing $V(6)$, $V(8)$ and $I_x$, we can determine $R_{eq}$ ($R_{eq}=\frac{V_x}{I_x}$), and compute the circuit's time constant ($\tau = R_{eq}C$).
\par The results output by Ngspice are presented in the following table.

\par Comparing the simulation with the theoretical prediction, we can compute the error associated to each value. The error values are presented in the table bellow.

\subsection{Third Point}
\label{ssec:3S}

\par In this point, the objective is to simulate the natural response of the circuit in node 6 for $t \in[0;20]$ms, that is, the evolution of this node's voltage throught time, when all independent sources are switched off. As the used boundary condition is $V(6)$ and $V(8)$ equal to the values found in point \ref{ssec:2S} for this nodes, we used the command \textit{.include} in the \textit{Ngspice's} script so that this values are imported automatically.
\par The obtained result is plotted bellow.
