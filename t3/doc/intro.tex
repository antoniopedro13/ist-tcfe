% state the learning objective 
\par The objective of this laboratory assignment is to design and analyse an AC/DC converter. In order to do this, we chose the envelope detector circuit, as well as the voltage regulator circuit. The architecture of our circuit can be seen in the following picture.

\par One way to get a stable DC output voltage is, in the first hand, to use a full wave rectifier - this circuit allows us to use every half-period of the input voltage. As we can see, diodes 1 and 4, as well as diodes 2 and 3 work in pairs, in order to allow us using the full lenght of the wave. In the other hand, to reduce the voltage output variations, we used a capacitor.
\par Finally, in order to maintain the DC component in the desired value, and to minimize the AC component, we used a series of diodes (because once they get activated, their output voltage is constant, no matter what the supply voltage or current are), in series with a resistor.
