\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\par In this laboratory assignment, the goal of conceiving an AC/DC converter was achieved. As seen in the whole report, the theoretical results (obtained using Octave) didn't exactly match the simulated ones (obtained using NGspice) because of the non-linearity of the diodes (as predicted), but overall the final result was pretty decent and it's good enough to validate the model used in the theoretical analysis.
