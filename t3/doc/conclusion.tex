\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\par In this laboratory assignment, the goal of analysing the natural, forced and frequency response of a transient RC circuit has been achieved. As seen in the whole report, the theoretical results (obtained using Octave) matched the simulation ones (obtained using Ngspice simulator) with negligible absolute errors (less than $0.05$ as seen in the tables above. Even though, the match isn't perfect, because of the many elements that are included in it and the non-linearity associated, it's good enough to validate the model used in the theoretical analysis. Although the match is almost perfect, we have to say that if the data were obtained in a real situation, this result would be very hard to achieve, since we had to take into acount other systhematic and accidental errors that might have occurred, as well as phenomena like joule effect in the conductors.
