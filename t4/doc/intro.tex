\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\par The goal of this laboratory assignment was to optimize a given audio amplifier, and doing both the theoretical and simulation analysis. The architecture of the given circuit can be seen in the following picture.

\par The input of this circuit is connected to an independent voltage source, which generates an ac signal with an amplitude of $10mV$. The source has an impedance of $100\Omega$, and the amplifier is going to be connected to a speaker which has an impedance of $8\Omega$. As we can see in the previous picture, the circuit is supplied by an independent 12V DC source (vcc).
\par The circuit comprises a gain stage and an output stage, which will be seen in a more detailed way in section \ref{sec:theoretical}.
